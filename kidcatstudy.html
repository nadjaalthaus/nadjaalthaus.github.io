 <p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">
 Thank you for your interest in this study. Before you decide whether to let your child take part, please read the following information carefully.
</p>

<h3>What is this study looking at?</h3>

<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">We are inviting your child to participate in this research study because your child is aged between 3-5 years old. The purpose of this research study is to investigate how young children group new animals into different categories and how children infer that different animals are members of the same category. By investigating children’s category learning behaviours researchers can develop a greater understanding of how different object properties, such as visual similarity or information about the animal (e.g. what the animal eats), contribute to categorisation during young childhood .
</p>
<h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>

<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">It is up to you to decide whether you let your child take part in this study. If you agree to let your child take part you will be asked to complete an online consent form. You are free to withdraw your child's participation at any time. This will not affect your child in any way. Likewise, if your child seems uncomfortable or unhappy you can stop the study at any time by closing the web page.
</p>

<h3>What will happen if I agree to take part?</h3>

<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">If you agree for your child to take part in this study, their involvement will last for one online game-based task that will take no longer than 20 minutes. During this study you will accompany your child as they complete an online game from your home-based PC (e.g. laptop/computer/tablet). You will be asked to complete a few demographic questions addressing some basic information about your child, including whether s/he has any vision or hearing problems and whether your child is exposed to any other languages besides English. You will also read a brief instruction sheet detailing the online task activities. In this game your child will be introduced to new cartoons of animal families that are each celebrating their own Birthday parties. Some friends of these animals are late to the party that they are attending and need help getting to the right party on time. Your child will help out by deciding which family the animal belongs to and therefore which party to attend. Your child will also help the animals out by deciding what type of cake different families would prefer.
</p>

<h3>Are there any problems with taking part?</h3>

<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">You may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In addition to these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate being associated with this study. It is possible that your child may become bored or frustrated with the study activities or screen time associated with this study. You may take breaks with your child during this study or close the web page to end the study session at any time.
<h3>Will it help me if I take part?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">Your child will not benefit personally from being in this study. However, we hope that, in the future other people might benefit from this study because understanding what information infants store is critical for our understanding of category learning, inductive generalisation and word learning which assists in understanding language and cognitive development more thoroughly.
</p>
<h3>Will it cost me anything to be in this study?</h3>

<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">There are no costs associated with taking part in this study.
</p>
<h3>Will I be paid for participating?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">There is no reimbursement for participating in this study.
</p>
<h3>How will you store the information that I give you?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">All information which you provide during the study will be stored in accordance with the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation and kept strictly confidential. All information and data collected during this study will be protected on the Gorilla.sc server and when downloaded shall be stored in an anonymised form on password protected computers.
</p>
<h3>How will the data be used?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">The results of this study will be written up and presented by a Masters student for their dissertation research project as part of their MSc Developmental Science degree. All data will be presented anonymously so that your child cannot be identified.
</p>
<h3>What happens if I agree to take part, but change my mind later?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">Taking part in this research study is completely voluntary. You may choose not to let your child take part at all. But if you do decide to let your child take part, you may stop participation at any time by closing the web page immediately or by choosing the option ‘please do not use my data’ at the end of the study. Your data will be destroyed and will not be included in the final dissertation write up. The end of this study is the last opportunity to withdraw, as after this point all data will be anonymised. If you decide not to have your child in this study, or if you stop participation at any time, your child will not be penalised or lose any benefits for which s/he would otherwise qualify.
</p>
<h3>How do I know this research is safe for me to take part in?</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">All research in the University is looked at by an independent group of people called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your safety, rights, wellbeing and dignity. This research was approved by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of East Anglia.
</p>
<h3>You are under no obligation to agree to take part in this research</h3>
<p class="w3-justify w3-large w3-text-black">If you do agree you can withdraw at any time without giving reason
