<h2>How does orthography affect the way word sounds are represented in our minds?</h2>

<br>
<br>
<h4> The problem </h4>

<p> In many languages there are words like “two” vs. “too” and “toe” vs. “tow” that sound 
the same but differ in spelling. How does this affect our mental representations of them? 
Similarly there are words that sound different even though their spelling is the same, e.g. “read” 
(present tense, [ri:d]) vs. “read” (past tense, [r&#603;d]).

The difficulty in examining these mental representations, and how phonology and orthography 
interact, is that such cases are not numerous.



<h4> The study </h4>
In Bengali verb inflection there is a completely regular vowel raising process that allows
 us to investigate this systematically. In Bengali the first and third person singular either 
 have the same or a raised stem vowel. For instance, ‘mare’ (s/he hits) becomes ‘mari’ 
 (I hit; no stem vowel raising, merely the suffix changes to indicate 1st Person), 
 but kh&aelig;le ‘he/she plays’ changes to kheli ‘I play’ (i.e. here the [&aelig;] 
 is raised to [e] in the first person), and similarly for lekhe/likhi (s/he writes / I write) 
 the stem vowel is also raised. Most importantly, only the e-i alternation (but not the &aelig;-e 
 alternation) is reflected in a spelling change (i.e. ae and e in khaele, kheli have the same Bengali 
 spelling).


<br>
This gave us a way to test how speakers of Bengali represent these sounds in the mental 
lexicon with a "fragment completion task": we played them the first syllable of a verb (e.g. 
kh&aelig;- or khe-) and their task was to determine whether this came from kh&aelig;le or from kheli. 
For their response, they saw both options written in Bengali letters on a screen and were asked 
to press a button corresponding to the target – but we also recorded their eye movements 
with an eye tracker.


<h4> Results</h4>
We expected participants to be unable to decide when hearing “ma”, because “mari” and 
“mare” share the stem vowel. That’s exactly what we found.
By contrast, we expected participants to find this easy whenever the stem vowel changes 
(either from [&aelig;] to [e], or from [e] to [i]). Any differences between pairs like 
kh&aelig;le/kheli (no spelling change) and lekhi/likhi (spelling change) should then be 
attributed to the impact of orthography, because the differences in vowel are 
perceptually similar in both cases.

However, it turns out that participants were really good at performing the task for the 
lekhe/likhi group of words (with a spelling difference), but surprisingly bad at finding 
the correct answer for the khaele/khele-type words (where there is no difference in spelling). 
In fact, their manual responses for these words were at chance – only their eye movements 
showed that in fact they could solve the question. Apparently spelling has a really big 
impact on how we “hear” sounds. 




<br>

We determined this by examining the time course of looking from the first target the 
partcipant looked at. In general, if the target is seen first, participants tend to 
stay there, whereas if the distracter is seen first, they move away to the other item – 
but when we compare trials on which the subject started at target vs. distracter, 
the distance between those data plots tells us how easy they found it to decide: 
If the plots are close together, they could not decide (target/distracter lead to 
the same responses), whereas if they are far apart, they found it easy (they looked at 
the target more than the distracter).
<br>
<h4> Modelling Approach </h4>

Statistically, to determine whether the eye movement patterns were distinct, we used a growth
curve approach (Mirman, 2014). This involves fitting 
polynomials to the time course data (using lme4 in R and logistic models) and 
successively added fixed effects to the base model. Model comparisons then showed that 
all three word types were different from each other; for the mare-mari group of words 
there was no difference between target-first and distracter-first (i.e. subjects had to guess), 
but both kh&aelig;le-kheli and lekhe-lekhi word groups were discriminated. It’s also clear, 
though, that the participants found the decision much easier for lekhe-lekhi 
(large distance, even early on) than for kh&aelig;le-kheli (small distance throughout). 


<br>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>

What the results overall mean is that orthography affects our mental representations 
of phonological patterns. We believe that exposure to the differences in spelling over 
and over again (and the need to produce the correct spelling in writing) means that the 
mental representation of those word forms become more distinct. Where there is no spelling 
change, the mental representations for 1st and 3rd person forms overlap to a large extent, 
which makes them confusable. In this experiment, once the mental representation is activated, 
memory for the acoustic input decays rapidly, and this may mean that both forms seem like good 
competitors for those items where the mental representation overlaps.
