<h2>What is the nature of babies’ first word representations?</h2>



<br>


<br>
<br>
<h4> The problem </h4>

Word recognition is a complex task: On the one hand, we don’t want to confuse similar words 
such as “pat” and “bat”. On the other hand, we need a lot of flexibility to cope with 
different speakers’ individual voice, different accents and with environmental noise. 
So our mental representation of what a word like “dog” should sound like needs to be 
exactly at the right level of specificity.
When children first learn words, to they store them in their mental lexicon with all 
the detail adults represent, or do they perhaps only store coarse representations? 
Such an “underspecified” lexical entry might easily be misrecognized.

However, according to the linguistic theory of the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon 
(FUL, Lahiri & Reetz, 2010)  even adults have underspecified lexical representations. 
Specifically, the theory predicts that so-called coronal sounds like [n],[t],[d],[s] 
that are produced with the “corona”of the tongue, the outer edge, are underspecified 
in order to deal with variability in speech. For instance:

Rainbow is pronounced as [re&#618;<b>m</b>bo&#650;]
Rain coat is pronounced as [re&#618;<b>&#331;</b>ko&#650;t]

These so called ‘assimilation’ patterns occur across many languages, and assimilation 
happens for coronals but not noncoronals (e.g. ).



<h4> The study </h4>
Using a visual world paradigm with eye tracking we tested 18- and 24-month-olds on their 
recognition for words starting with coronal sounds vs. noncoronal sounds. If their 
coronals are indeed underspecified, they should not be sensitive for mispronunciation – 
e.g. they should recognise both [dog] and [bog] to mean “dog”.

Figure 1. Sample stimuli: pairs of "novel" and "familiar" items.
<br><br>

We showed children pairs of the familiar target (e.g. duck, bear) and a “novel” 
object/animal (see Figure 1), and just before the pictures came up on the screen, the children 
heard either the accurate label for the familiar picture (duck/bear) OR a mispronounced 
version (*buck/*dare).
If infants noticed the mispronunciation, they should be more likely to look at the 
novel image (as that is a potential referent for a novel word). Therefore, if coronals 
are underspecified (but noncoronals are fully specified), there should be a difference 
between words that start with a coronal vs. those that start with a non-coronal sound:

For coronals like duck, dog, door we expect no or less mispronunciation sensitivity 
than for noncoronals like bear, bird, book (for which children should notice mispronunciations).

<br>

<h4> Results</h4>
Overall we found that children noticed mispronunciations: they looked less at the 
target if the word was pronounced accurately (p=.011). Their overall looking proportions 
did not show differences between coronal-onset words and non-coronal onset words. 

However, we can get much clearer insight into word processing if we examine the time 
course of looking across the entire trial. When the pictures are shown, children either 
start at the target or the novel item. If the picture matches what they heard, they tend 
to stay there, but if it doesn’t, they move their eyes to the other picture. In 
consequence, differences between looking patterns on trials with an accurate vs. 
mispronounced auditory item tell us to what extent the children were sensitive to the
 mispronunciation.

Figure 2 shows looking patterns for those trials on which the familiar item was first 
looked at (results from novel-first trials overall show a consistent pattern).

<h4> Modelling Approach </h4>

We used growth curve analysis (logistic mixed effects models, Mirman, 2014) to 
determine which of the curves were statistically different from each other. To this 
end we fitted 3rd order polynomials first in a base model that only contained the 
polynomial time terms, then added fixed effects and conducted a model comparison 
after every step, and finally ran posthoc comparisons to determine which conditions 
showed a mispronunciation effect. The best-fit model (for familiar-first trials) 
included 3-way interactions of Age, Condition and Onset sound (p<.0001). Posthoc 
tests showed that 18-month-olds had a clear mispronunciation effect for all onset 
sounds, i.e. no asymmetry and therefore no underspecification. By contrast, 
24-month-olds’ looking patterns showed an onset-effect: For noncoronal words, the 
toddlers were sensitive to mispronunciation (i.e. “dare” is not “bear”). But for 
coronal words, the looking patterns were not statistically different.


<br>
<h4> Conclusion </h4>

The implication is that children indeed appear to “underspecify” lexical entries for 
coronal sounds, and this likely enables dealing with assimilation. However, the really 
interesting finding here is that this was found only with older children and not at 
18 months. That means it is the result of experience with language – in this case, 
experience of hearing words in different contexts (such as “rain” in rainbow and 
rain coat, pronounced as [m] and [&#331;]).
